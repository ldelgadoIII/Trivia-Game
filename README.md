# Trivia-Game

## Website Summary

Welcome to my website where you can play a trivia game! You are able to click the start button to begin the game and questions will start appearing. Once you click an answer the next question will appear and you will be notified if your answer was correct or incorrect from a prompt below. Additionally, if you get a question incorrectly then your time and score will be deducted by 10 points. At the end of the game you are greeted with a game over screen and the option to save your name with your score. There is a tab that will direct you to the highscore page where you can view your saved scores. I found this project to be the most challenging so far as I had to tackle local storage for the first time. I found it very valuable to separate files depending on its features, for instance creating a separate js page for my highscore page made debugging and running the program much easier.
